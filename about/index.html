                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Kevin Liu, a mechanical engineer with a passion for exploring the intersections 
                    of engineering, technology, and creative expression. My work spans across traditional 
                    mechanical engineering disciplines while incorporating modern technological approaches 
                    and innovative problem-solving methods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I focus on bridging the gap between mechanical engineering principles 
                    and emerging technologies. Through my work and personal projects, I explore how 
                    traditional engineering practices can be enhanced and reimagined using modern tools 
                    and methodologies.
                </p>

                    On this site, you'll find:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Essays</strong> - Where I share my thoughts on engineering, technology, and their 
                    intersection with society. I write about both technical challenges and broader implications 
                    of engineering in our world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Engineering</strong> - A showcase of my technical projects and explorations in 
                    mechanical engineering. This section documents my hands-on work and practical applications 
                    of engineering principles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Games</strong> - A creative outlet where I explore interactive experiences and game 
                    development, combining technical skills with creative design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I believe in sharing knowledge and experiences openly, hoping to contribute to the broader 
                    engineering community while continuing to learn and grow in my field.
