Writing should not be a daunting task. Especially for me, since I know and understand my situation. And yet, I find myself writing in my head more often than my pen on paper (or on this typewriter). It's much easier to browse Twitter (X) to see what happened and random people reacting extremely to said events (true or not) than it is to take a breath and consider what to do to better your day. It is much easier to read other's words than crafting your own. It is easier still, to note pieces of writing that are provably false, have a moment of internal monologue (haha they used there instead of they're), and move on. Some even find pleasure in announcing to the world (if X is the global town square /doubtful) what a silly mistake the previous reply made.
If you consume a certain type or style of media, and purely consume that, then you become closer to that source. Whether it's a comic strip newspaper artist, a series of young adult/teenager books, a partisan news anchor, or a British comedian who has absolutely no baking experience, all the senses are captured. Like in Inside Out 2, everything shapes you and your values as a person (and member of society).
I do want to eventually publish something. That means I'm going to have to read a lot, write a lot, and fix a lot of my own mistakes. To be honest, I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into. Anyway, these are just some of my thoughts. I deleted X again - if I read, it'll be a real, paperbound book.
See you,
Kevin
